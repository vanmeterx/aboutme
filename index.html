        <h3>Education</h3>
        <p>
            Never stop learning. My education tends to exceed what I learned through the University system (at <a href="http://www.uni.edu" target="_blank">University of Northern Iowa</a>). 
            While UNI taught me art history, design history, and making things look cool, corporate training programs filled in for most the rest of my Graphic Design degree. 
            Full blown knowledge in Quark Xpress and Adobe products are just a few.
        </p>
        <p>
            After three or four years focused on my employment, I decided to finally follow through the photography knowledge, something that had been lingering thanks to family and close family friends. 
            After taking the full course schedule for photography at <a href="http://www.kirkwood.edu" target="_blank">Kirkwood</a> the professor, admiring my work, invited me to continue courses as independent study,
            to develop my darkroom skills, to be creative, and to help out the incoming classes on darkroom techniques.

        <h3>Artwork</h3>
        <p>
            My artwork ranges from cycling merchandise to conceptual art and photography. Two cycling jerseys I have created are proudly displayed in establishments here in Cedar Rapids.
            If you happen to be at The Kickstand downtown, or The Shack Tavern near the cedar river, the framed jerseys displayed there are my creations.</p>
        <p>
            At the Kirkwood Community College Extension in Belle Plaine, Iowa, you may be able to spot 6 <a href="http://monitorhead.awardspace.com" target="_blank">monitorhead</a> photographs lining the halls
            and possibly classrooms there. More images can be found through my <a href="https://vanmeter.deviantart.com/" target="_blank">Deviant Art</a> site.
